# KMeans_Clustering_model
In this project, we have a dataset of mall customers (Mall_Customers) which shows data of customers who 
visit the mall and make various purchases there. In this dataset, we have the columns 
Customer_id, Gender, Age, Annual Income and Spending Score (which is a score allotted to 
the customer based on how much they spend at the mall. The more the spending score, the 
more they have spent at the mall). The objective of this project is to calculate some patterns in 
the data, thereby determining which group or cluster of customers should be targeted for 
advertising and promotions. This project also categorizes customers into different groups (like 
careless, sensible, careful and so on). As a result, the findings of this project will allow to make 
relevant recommendations to desired customers thereby increasing the overall profit of the 
mall.
